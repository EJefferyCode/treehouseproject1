# treehouseproject1

<h1>This project is a sample version of an assignment I did whilst taking one of TeamTreeHouse's http://www.teamtreehouse.com 
course</h1>

Although my scope of experience extends beyond HTML5 and Css3, I felt it necessary to gain a "refresher" in order to complete the
more advanced work properly. Although, I will say, that I did correctly learn how to create a mobile version of a site, and THEN
create the desktop and tablet version subsquently. 

Updates may be added at a later date.
